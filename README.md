# Pavolume

Simple script for changing volume and muting the default Pulseaudio sink written in Python.
<br>
<br> The script was made for my Bspwm setup with Dunst as a notification manager, but you are of course free to modify it to suit your needs.
<br>
<br> Pulsectl Python library is needed. `pip install pulsectl`
